TELLme-HUB - Geoinformation Enabling ToolkIT starterkitÂ® (GET-IT)
========================================

TELLme - Erasmus Plus project n. 2017-1-IT02-KA203-036974. 
Training for Education, Learning and Leadership towards a new MEtropolitan discipline.

TELLme Hub,  is developed in the context of "Output 4" (O4) of TELLme project.
It represents the data infrastructure for the project. It serves as a geospatial data repository, a data and metadata catalogue. It offers functionalities for editing metadata according to project-specific metadata profile. Peculiarity of the metadata editing tool within the Hub is its ability to let users compose metadata exploiting resources from the semantic web, by performing queries against SPARQL endpoints specified within the project profile.

TELLme-HUB is a fork of the main GET-IT platform, a Geonode project that allows you to easily share geospatial data on the web with simple actions. 

TELLme-HUB, on the basis of the main GET-IT functionalities, exploits the Semantics of the TELLme Project to organize geospatial data and maps. The module tellme contains the logics to transform the TELLme Glossary served by the omonimous remote application (developed by TELLme Project O2).

GET-IT is the first open-source collaborative effort toward the integration of traditional geographic information with observational data.
