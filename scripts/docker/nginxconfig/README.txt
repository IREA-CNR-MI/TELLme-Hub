This folder contains the nginx.conf file that should be copied to the named volumes nginx-conf-dir.
TODO: examine how to link this resource (that in this branch contains the necessary nginx configuration to expose taverna and taverna-player-portal) to the running nginx.
Is it the right strategy to make it possible to change nginx config and make them available within the source code of starterkit?
